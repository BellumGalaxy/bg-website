# Introduction

Hey! Hello!
Welcome to the Bellum Galaxy website repository.

Here you can check how we structure the application and the pure content.

You can check out the Application on the provisional address [here](https://bellumgalaxy.com).

# Version
## v0.1
In this version, we have only a homepage and an About page. It's available only for desktop access. Access made by a mobile device will not display correctly.
Responsiveness will be added in v0.2.
## v0.2
In this version, we updated the layout to be responsive. Now the website can be accessed on any device correctly.

# Tools
- React
- Next.Js
- Netlify
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI

# Functionality
## v0.1
In this version, the website is for information purposes only. You can access our social media through links, get more information about our team, and learn about our project.

NOTE: Our focus is on the Brazilian community, so the website was developed in Portuguese.
