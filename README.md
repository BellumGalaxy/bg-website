# Introduction

Hey! Hello!
Welcome to the Bellum Galaxy website repository.

Here you can check how we structure the application and the pure content.

You can check out the Application [here](https://bellumgalaxy.com).

# Functionality
## Current Version - 0.2
In this version, the website is for information purposes only. You can access our social media through links, get more information about our team, and learn about our project.

NOTE: Our focus is on the Brazilian community, so the website was developed in Portuguese.

# Version
## v0.1
In this version, we have only a homepage and an About page. It's available only for desktop access. Access made by a mobile device will not display correctly.
Responsiveness will be added in v0.2.
## v0.2
In this version, we updated the layout to be responsive. Now the website can be accessed on any device correctly.

# Tools
